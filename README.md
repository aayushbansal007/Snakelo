# Flutter Snake Game

This repository contains the source code for a simple yet engaging Snake Game built with Flutter. The game revives the classic gameplay of the traditional Snake game with additional features that enhance the experience.

## Features

- **Classic Snake Gameplay**: Control the snake to eat food, grow in size, and avoid collisions with the walls or itself.
- **Scoring System**: Points are earned each time the snake eats food.
- **Dynamic Background**: Experience a changing background color every 30 seconds for a dynamic visual effect.
- **Time Tracking**: Keep track of the time elapsed since the start of the game.
- **Increasing Difficulty**: The snake's speed gradually increases, making the game more challenging as you play.
